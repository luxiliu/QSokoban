Sokoban is a traditional japanese warehouse keeper game. You can find this game in KDE, which is with the name KSokoban. And there is also an edition to run Zaurus. You can find it in http://www.linux-solutions.at/projects/zaurus/games-Sokoban.html.

I referred these two editions' source, re-developed and simplified for Qtopia Opensource 4.3.1. You could find a snapshort in ../images/snapshot.png

Thanks to Anders Widell, Steve Dunham, Robert Ernst and the providers of the images.

Basic Installation:
